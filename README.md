# Whiskey Drop
This is a website for a made up company offering subscribers a monthly delivery of a selection of fine whiskeys.

This project was developed mainly as a learning tool exploring the design possibilities of Bootstrap.

There is no functioning backend code on the site. All sign-up buttons are dummy, popping up a dummy sign-up form.

In addition, the website is a single page application so the nav links are also dummy.
